## **Introduction**
#
In this project, I have been approached by Horiseon, a marketing agency, which have hired me to refactor an existing codebase to make it more accessible.

## **Description** 
#
I have been given a file named Develop, which contains the starter code to refactor. It involves an HTML and CSS file, which I will review and refactor any neccessary changes in order to make the site more accessible to search engines.
